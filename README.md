*An EC-Earth4 basic evaluation tool*

This is the painful road to switch from bash to python3 as a scripting interface.
As in the previous ECmean, all computations and weights are done with CDO. However, python3 is taking care of the script in place of bash, and YML files are using to handle all the configuration/metadata required. EC-Earth4 data and CMIP5/CMIP6 data are supported.

A complete [ReadTheDocs Documentation](https://ecmean4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is being developed, please refer to this.
